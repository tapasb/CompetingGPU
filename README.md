### Project Description

To make a simple game that uses at least two GPUs as competitors, let's make a basic Tic-Tac-Toe game. Each GPU will use a different strategy to play the game. We'll use CUDA to make the decision-making process on each GPU happen at the same time.

1. **Start the Game Board**: Show the Tic-Tac-Toe board as a 3x3 matrix.
2. **Come up with Strategies**: Make two different strategies for the GPUs.
    - **GPU 1 Strategy**: Choose a random move.
    - **GPU 2 Strategy**: Use a simple rule to block the opponent.
3. **CUDA Kernels**: Write CUDA kernels for each strategy.
4. **Game Loop**: Take turns between the two GPUs until the game ends.
5. **Output**: Show the game board after each move and find out who wins.

### Pseudocode

1. Start the game board.
2. Write CUDA kernels for each strategy.
3. In the game loop:
    - Copy the board to the GPU.
    - Run the strategy kernel.
    - Copy the board back to the main computer.
    - Check if someone wins or it's a draw.
4. Show the final board and the winner.

### Code Description

1. **Starting Point**: The game board is set to 0 (empty).
2. **CUDA Kernels**:
    - `randomMove`: Picks a random empty cell and puts the player's mark.
    - `blockOpponentMove`: Tries to block the opponent's winning move or makes a random move.
3. **Game Loop**:
    - Takes turns between the two GPUs.
    - Copies the board to the GPU, runs the strategy, and copies the board back.
    - Checks if someone wins or it's a draw after each move.
4. **Output**: Shows the board after each move and announces the winner or a draw.

This code shows a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game where two GPUs compete using different strategies. You can improve the strategies and add more advanced decision-making processes.
